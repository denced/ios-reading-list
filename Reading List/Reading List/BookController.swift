     Inside of a do-try-catch- block, unwrap the readingListURL property.
     Still inside of the block, use the Data(contentsOf: URL) initializer to get access to the property list form of the books. Assign this data you initialize to a constant.
     Initialize a PropertyListDecoder and assign it to a constant.
     Create a constant called decodedBooks. Set its value by calling the decode method on the property list decoder you just created, and passing in the type it should be decoded as, and the data constant you made a couple steps ago. (Hint: the type parameter to this function should be [Book].self)
     Set the value of the books property in the BookController to the decodedBooks you just made.

     Like always, we will need to make CRUD methods. As we're using a form of persistence, be sure to call saveToPersistentStore() at the end of each of these or the changes will not persist:

     Add a "Create" method that initializes a new Book object. In order to persist the newly created Book, call the saveToPersistentStore() method at the end of this function.
     Add a "Delete" method that passes in a Book object as a parameter, and removes it from the books array.
     We'll need two "Update" methods:
     One is to update a Book object's hasBeenRead property. Call it updateHasBeenRead(for book: Book). It should simply swap the hasBeenRead value from false to true and vice-versa.
     The other is to edit the Book's title and/or reasonToRead properties.
